2. Special Fields:

   a) Function Call:
   ```python
   "function_call": {
       "name": "get_weather",
       "arguments": '{"location": "New York"}'
   }
   ```
   - Purpose: Instruct the system to call a specific function.
   - Usage: Trigger external actions or data retrieval.
   - Subcategories:
     - API calls
     - Database queries
     - Computation requests

3. Potential Expansions:

   a) Metadata:
   ```python
   {
       "role": "user",
       "content": user_query,
       "metadata": {
           "timestamp": "2023-08-26T10:30:00Z",
           "user_id": "12345",
           "sentiment": "positive"
       }
   }
   ```
   - Purpose: Provide additional context or tracking information.
   - Usage: Enhance analysis, personalization, or debugging.

   b) Attachments:
   ```python
   {
       "role": "user",
       "content": "What's in this image?",
       "attachments": [
           {
               "type": "image",
               "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
   - Purpose: Include non-text data in the conversation.
   - Usage: Enable multi-modal interactions.

4. Potential Uses and Capabilities:

   a) Complex Conversations:
   - Multi-turn dialogues with context retention
